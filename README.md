# dotfiles

This is my CLI setup. I've got a handy script to apply it to a fresh install of an OS.

This repo is:

* Mostly for my own benefit. 
* Made public for my convenience and your curiosity. 
* Perpetually a work in progress.
* No warranty offered ;-)

## Quick install (everything)

> bash -c "`curl -L https://github.com/rklyne/dotfiles/raw/master/webinstall.sh`"
